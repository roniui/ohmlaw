# ITI Electrician Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is a unit, and how do you measure current and voltage?
A unit refers to a standard measurement. Current is measured in amperes (A) using an ammeter, and voltage is measured in volts (V) using a voltmeter.

## 2. What is the difference between current and voltage?
Current is the flow of electric charge, measured in amperes, while voltage is the electric potential difference between two points, measured in volts.

## 3. Define ampere and explain how it is measured.
An ampere is the unit of electric current. It is measured using an ammeter connected in series with the load.

## 4. What is a capacitor, and what is its function in a circuit?
A capacitor stores electrical energy and is used for filtering, smoothing, and starting motors.

## 5. Explain the working principle of a transformer.
A transformer works on the principle of electromagnetic induction to transfer electrical energy between circuits through inductively coupled conductors.

## 6. How many types of transformers are there?
Main types include step-up, step-down, power, distribution, and isolation transformers.

## 7. What is the function of a transformer?
To increase or decrease voltage levels in AC electrical circuits.

## 8. What is power factor, and why is it important?
Power factor is the ratio of real power to apparent power. A high power factor indicates efficient utilization of electrical power.

## 9. Differentiate between AC and DC currents.
AC (Alternating Current) changes direction periodically, while DC (Direct Current) flows in one direction.

## 10. What is the significance of earthing in electrical systems?
Earthing provides a safe path for fault current, preventing electric shocks and equipment damage.

## 11. Explain the star-delta starter control diagram.
It is used to reduce the starting current of motors by initially connecting in star and then switching to delta.

## 12. What is the difference between AC and DC motors?
AC motors run on alternating current and are generally used in appliances; DC motors run on direct current and offer precise speed control.

## 13. How does a DC motor work?
It converts electrical energy into mechanical energy using the interaction between magnetic fields and conductors.

## 14. What are the types of motor starters?
Types include DOL (Direct-On-Line), star-delta, autotransformer, and soft starters.

## 15. What is the function of a starter in a motor circuit?
To safely start and stop the motor and provide overload protection.

## 16. Describe the working principle of an induction motor.
It works on electromagnetic induction, where a rotating magnetic field induces current in the rotor.

## 17. What is the purpose of a capacitor in a single-phase motor?
To create a phase shift and generate a rotating magnetic field for starting torque.

## 18. How do you determine the rotation direction of a motor?
By interchanging any two supply lines of a three-phase motor.

## 19. What is slip in an induction motor?
Slip is the difference between synchronous speed and rotor speed, expressed as a percentage.

## 20. Explain the concept of synchronous speed.
It is the speed at which the magnetic field rotates in a motor, calculated by 120*f/P.

## 21. How do you perform termination for a control panel?
By stripping the wire, crimping lugs, and securely connecting them to terminal blocks as per the wiring diagram.

## 22. What are the standard color codes for wiring?
Live: Red/Brown, Neutral: Black/Blue, Earth: Green/Yellow.

## 23. How do you test panel cables and ensure proper connections?
Using a continuity tester or multimeter to check for open, short, and correct polarity.

## 24. What is the procedure for installing a ceiling fan?
Fix the hook, install the downrod, connect wires properly, and mount the fan securely.

## 25. How do you wire a three-phase motor?
Connect each motor terminal to each phase, ensure correct rotation direction, and use appropriate overload protection.

## 26. What safety precautions should be taken during wiring?
Turn off power, use insulated tools, wear gloves, and follow proper wiring diagrams.

## 27. Explain the difference between series and parallel circuits.
In series, current is the same through all components. In parallel, voltage is the same across branches.

## 28. How do you calculate the load for a particular circuit?
By adding the wattages of all connected devices and dividing by voltage to get current.

## 29. What is the purpose of a distribution board?
To distribute electrical power to various circuits and protect them using MCBs or fuses.

## 30. Describe the process of conduit wiring.
It involves running wires through metal or plastic conduits for protection and neatness.

## 31. Describe the maintenance work in a power plant.
It includes checking generators, transformers, breakers, and ensuring all systems operate efficiently.

## 32. How do you troubleshoot a tripped circuit breaker?
Check for overload, short circuit, or ground fault, then reset after fixing the issue.

## 33. What steps do you take to identify a short circuit?
Visual inspection, use of multimeter, and isolating sections to find the fault.

## 34. How do you test the insulation resistance of a cable?
Using a megger to measure resistance between conductor and earth.

## 35. What is the procedure for replacing a faulty switch?
Turn off the power, remove the cover, disconnect and replace the switch, then test.

## 36. How do you handle a situation where a fuse blows repeatedly?
Find and fix the underlying cause like overload or short circuit before replacing the fuse.

## 37. What tools are essential for electrical maintenance?
Screwdrivers, pliers, multimeter, wire strippers, insulation tape, and testers.

## 38. How do you ensure the reliability of an electrical system?
Regular maintenance, using quality components, and testing connections.

## 39. What is preventive maintenance, and why is it important?
Scheduled inspections and servicing to avoid unexpected breakdowns.

## 40. Explain the steps to calibrate an energy meter.
Compare readings with a standard, adjust the calibration screw or settings if required.

## 41. What personal protective equipment (PPE) should an electrician use?
Insulated gloves, safety shoes, helmet, and safety glasses.

## 42. How do you ensure compliance with electrical safety standards?
Follow national codes (like IS/IEC), use certified components, and maintain documentation.

## 43. What is the importance of lockout/tagout procedures?
To ensure machines are de-energized and prevent accidental start during maintenance.

## 44. Describe the first aid steps for an electric shock victim.
Turn off power, do not touch the victim directly, call for help, and perform CPR if trained.

## 45. What are the common hazards in electrical work, and how do you mitigate them?
Electric shock, fire, arc flash—use PPE, proper tools, and follow safety protocols.

## 46. How do you handle electrical fires?
Turn off power, use a CO₂ or dry chemical fire extinguisher, never use water.

## 47. What is the role of circuit breakers in safety?
They interrupt current flow in case of overload or short circuit, preventing damage.

## 48. Explain the significance of residual current devices (RCDs).
RCDs detect leakage currents and disconnect the supply to prevent shock.

## 49. What are the safety measures for working at heights?
Use safety harness, stable ladders, and avoid carrying tools in hands while climbing.

## 50. How do you stay updated with the latest electrical codes and standards?
Attend training sessions, read technical books, and follow updates from regulatory authorities.
