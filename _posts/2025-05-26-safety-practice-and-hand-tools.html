Usually, the total number of pages for a particular word count will be determined only based on two factors such as the formatting style and the writing medium. No matter whether it is academic or professional work, you will be asked to submit the content either in handwritten or typed format.

The handwritten and typed formats each have their own distinct writing style and font size. As a result, preparing the content for a given word limit will require a different total number of pages. The preferred format for both formats is A4 paper. The typed format has a lot more rules about fonts and page layout than the handwritten format. Word processors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs can be used to prepare a formal document in typed format.
